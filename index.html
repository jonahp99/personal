				<h2>SafeChat</h2>
				<p>
					For me, this project was an exploration of cryptography as well as my
					first foray into full-stack web development. It was the culmination of
					all the skills I'd learned in school up until that point, and my first
					attempt at tackling a new topic entirely foreign to me.
					<br /><br />
					At a time when Facebook is reading users' messages and online privacy
					has never been more important, I wanted to create something that
					allowed people to communicate online with confidence that no third
					party is reading their conversations. I implemented RSA encryption to
					enable just that -- users of my site can encrypt sensitive information
					and send it over any medium without fear of their message being read
					by anyone not intended to view it. The site also permits unregistered
					users a demo with fewer features if they don't want to create an
					account.

				<h2>Life in Color</h2>
				<p>
					My inspiration for Life in Color came from a journal I came across.
					This journal had a twist: in the back there was a calendar with 365
					contiguous squares. To the right of this was a color-code, with a
					spectrum of colors and associated emotions. The idea for this journal
					was that for each day you journaled, you also would pick a predominant
					emotion for that day and color the calendar accordingly. At the end of
					the year, you could reflect on the past year and find trends in your
					emotions.
					<br /><br />
					My site is similar. Every day you make a journal entry that is
					assigned to a spot on your calendar "Spectrum" page. However, rather
					than picking an emotion manually, I use sentiment analysis to assign
					emtions to your daily entries automatically. Building this project was
					incredibly rewarding, and allowed me combine my technical skills with
					my creativity to create something totally new.
